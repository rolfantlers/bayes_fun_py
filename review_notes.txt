Review: Why You Need to Read This Book

I wish this is the first book on probability I'd ever read. Or if not the first, the second.

This is far and away the most practical book on the subject.

If you're only explanation is with coins and dice, you are stuck in the ivory tower.

Why not R? Because I already felt competent enough in Python. No doubt that learning R would be a useful and enriching experience, but there are only so many hours in the day. Plus, forcing myself to translate this into Python would help me truly understand the material.

What practical examples are best?
